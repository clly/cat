Every so often I ended up opening up the command prompt for Windows and tried to cat a file. It never worked. Ever. The good thing about working with software is that if you don't like something or want something new you can always write it yourself. So I did. I ended up writing cat.exe in go. The next day I learned about the type command in windows which does the same thing. Oh well","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
